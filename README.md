## Procedure and result

The webdriver runs headless, which means the browser will actually not be visible. 
A couple of useful settings have been set:
- `"javascript.enabled", True`  It is here required that Javascript is enabled.
- `"permissions.default.image", 2,` No images will be loaded.
- `"plugin.state.flash", 0` Flash is set deactivated.
- `"toolkit.telemetry.unified", False` Telemetry is deactivated.

The following data is being extracted and saved into a `csv` spreadsheet:
- Company name
- Homepage URL
- Address
- Phone and Fax number
- Product categories (the sub-fields in which they operate)
- Description (a company's profile description)
